What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive results summary component using HTML and CSS. I became more comfortable with flexbox and media queries to adjust the layout based on different screen sizes. Additionally, I improved my skills in creating gradient backgrounds and applying hover effects to interactive elements.

Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on mastering CSS Grid and exploring more advanced CSS techniques for creating complex layouts. Additionally, I aim to incorporate JavaScript functionality to add interactivity and improve user experience.
